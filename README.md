HaggerNews.js 
=============

A Javascript script that replaces Hacker News comments and titles with
\`\`humourous'' replacements. It's intended to be a parody, and not taken
seriously. So please, dont.

It's currently provided with a manifest.json which can be used to load the
script as a Chrome extension. If you're looking to test it out, our just want
to install it, you can do so from the [chrome web store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/haggernewsjs/cpkikaclhgjjcfifjkmlodmeinbeibim).
